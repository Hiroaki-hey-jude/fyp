## Overview
We have identified several challenges in the agricultural industry through direct interviews with Japanese farmers. Firstly, one major issue is the lack of proper avenues for farmers to sell their products at fair prices and earn sufficient income. Many farmers live in poverty as intermediaries consistently deduct fees from the sale of their crops, leaving them with inadequate profits. Additionally, large-scale agriculture requires vast land, making it difficult for individual farmers to compete. Consequently, farmers often have no choice but to sell their crops at low prices.

The second problem is food loss. In Japan, more than one-third of all available food goes to waste and remains unsold. The primary reason for food being discarded is the strict cosmetic standards imposed by sales regulations. Consumers demand visually perfect produce, leading to the disposal of edible crops with minor imperfections.

The third challenge is the aging population of farmers. The average age of farmers in Japan is 67 years old. The agricultural industry is experiencing significant aging, making it difficult to pass down farming to future generations. To attract young people and increase the agricultural workforce, efforts to generate interest in farming among the youth are necessary.

To address these issues, this project aims to harness the power of technology to increase farmers' income and reduce global food waste.
